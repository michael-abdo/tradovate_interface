# Tradovate Multi-Account Interface - Credentials Configuration
# 
# This file contains example credentials for the Tradovate Interface.
# Copy this file to 'credentials.yaml' and replace with your actual credentials.
#
# Format: email: password
# 
# The system supports both YAML and JSON formats. YAML is recommended for readability.
# If you prefer JSON, you can use credentials.json instead.

# Example credentials (replace with your actual credentials)
your_email1@example.com: your_password1
your_email2@example.com: your_password2

# You can add as many accounts as needed
# account3@example.com: password3
# account4@example.com: password4

# Special account formats are also supported
# APEX_123456: apex_password
# NINJA_789012: ninja_password

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. Never commit your actual credentials to version control
# 2. Add 'credentials.yaml' to your .gitignore file
# 3. Consider using environment variables for sensitive production environments
# 4. Keep this file readable only by you (chmod 600 credentials.yaml on Unix systems)
